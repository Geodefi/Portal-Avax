   * * * TYPE 1: Senate: controls state of governance, contract updates and other members of A Universe
   * * * TYPE 2: Upgrade: address of the implementation for desired contract upgrade
   * * * TYPE 3: **gap** : formally it represented the admin contract, however since UUPS is being used as a upgrade path,
   * this TYPE is now reserved to make it easier for secondary contracts to add their own type.
   *
   * @param name: id is created by keccak(name)
   *
   * @param CONTROLLER: the address that refers to the change that is proposed by given proposal ID.
   * * This slot can be given the control of an id to a user, a new implementation contract, a new Senate etc.
   *
   * @param deadline: refers to last timestamp until a proposal expires, limited by MAX_PROPOSAL_DURATION
   * * Expired proposals can not be approved by Senate
   * * Expired proposals can be overriden by new proposals
